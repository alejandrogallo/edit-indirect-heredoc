#+title: Edit Indirect Heredoc
#+author: Alejandro Gallo

* Introduction

This package implements a minor mode for editing =HEREDOCS= in a
separate buffer similar to =org-mode='s =C-c \'= functionality.

For this, it simply uses the package [[https://github.com/Fanael/edit-indirect][edit-indirect]].

* Example

The name of the =HEREDOC= document will be the name of the mode
activated in the editing buffer, i.e., having

#+begin_src bash
dhall <<DHALL_MODE
let a = 2

let b = 2

in

{ a, b }
DHALL_MODE
#+end_src

if you do =C-c \'= in the dhall text, it will open a =dhall-mode= buffer.

* Installation

Right now the package is not on elpa, but you can load it from source,
the only dependency is =edit-indirect=.

You can turn on the minor mode using hooks, i.e.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(let ((heredoc-hooks '(sh-mode-hook
                       gnuplot-mode-hook)))
  (dolist (mode heredoc-hooks)
    (add-hook mode #'edit-indirect-heredoc-mode)))
#+end_src
